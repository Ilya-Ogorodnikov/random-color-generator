# Random color generator

This application allows you to generate up to 5 random colors. The name of each color can be copied by clicking on it. The colors are changed by pressing the "space bar".

Each color can be locked on the screen by clicking on the corresponding icon. When you press the "space bar" again, that color will remain on the screen.

The color codes are also substituted in the url, so that by copying the address and pasting it in a new tab, you can get the colors from the last tab.
